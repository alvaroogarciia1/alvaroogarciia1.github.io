    <p>
      I'm a <strong>Computer Engineering student</strong> at the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM),
      with a strong interest in <strong>backend development</strong>, systems programming and clean, well-structured code.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of my projects started as university assignments and evolved into personal learning challenges,
      where I focus on maintainable code, proper documentation and testing.
